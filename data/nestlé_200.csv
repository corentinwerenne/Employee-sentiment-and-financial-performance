From the beginning, there was lack of direction and communication from management about what was expected and how to obtain certain information (e.g., who was responsible for what information and who was important to involve in aspects of my work). Moreover, there appeared to have been little planning involved in terms of which projects would be my responsibility, the scope of these projects and consideration for the amount of time that these projects would realistically require for completion. I communicated my concerns\\u002Fneeds as an intern and what I would appreciate from my superiors in order to be successful. My managers attempted to listen to me, however, these discussions often didn’t lead to any change. As an intern, I wanted to show my independence and take initiative, but in order to reach this state of independence, I would have benefited from some guidance and mentorship (at the very least, at the beginning of my internship). Ultimately, I ended up learning a lot and honing my communication, organization and, most of all, my problem solving skills as a result of some of these challenges. However, regular feedback and check-ins from members of the team throughout my internship was lacking. Also, I would have greatly appreciated a formal brief and training at the beginning of my internship that explained important aspects of the business, overview of processes\\u002Fsystems, roles and introduction of cross functional teams, and relationships between cross-functional teams (e.g., where overlaps exists and how this would pertain to me and projects I was leading).\\n\\nOverall, I would say that Nestlé is not equipped to properly train, mentor and encourage new hires (especially young hires\\u002Finterns) to succeed in the workplace and there is a toxic culture. Managers expected way too much with zero direction or explanation of what was expected &amp; there was harsh criticism from certain cross-functional team members (I was once berated by a member of a cross-functional team during a group meeting for not knowing something that I was never taught because I never had formal training!). Perhaps it was just the specific team I was on - I do not know nor will I speak for the experiences of other interns who were placed on different teams within the company. I should also add, however, that it wasn’t just my division but HR was very unresponsive throughout my entire time at the company when I tried to reach out about concerns or just general questions I had.","""Try to foster a more inclusive and communicative environment from the top down so that new hires know what is expected of them and can deliver on projects while not feeling fearful of asking questions or making errors.
